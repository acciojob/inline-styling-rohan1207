	<p>Is it a bulb? Is it a root? No, it's a tuber! Commonly referred to as "bulbs" Dahlia tubers store food for the growing season that cluster together at the bottom of a stem. Dahlia tubers can have several growing points called eyes, and can get bigger each year making more growing points. Dahlias are easy to grow, put on an amazing show all summer long, and we're proud to offer one of the largest selections anywhere!</p></div>

Roses belong to the family of plants called Rosaceae. All roses were originally wild: they grew in North America, Europe, northwest Africa and many parts of Asia and Oceania. There are over 150 different species of roses. The wild rose species can be grown in gardens, but most garden roses are cultivars, which have been selected by people.[2]</p></div>
